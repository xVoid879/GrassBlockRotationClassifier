# TODO
Fork MisterX's Texture Rotation to add file uploading from a certain directory
Make the python script save the file as a formation.add format in that certain directory.
Make it build then run
If a user wants to do it again, it automatically deletes the build folder, then builds, then runs.
or we can use the c++ version that magic ate created
